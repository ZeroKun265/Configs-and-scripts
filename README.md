# ZeroKun265's Configs

This is just a bunch of configs that get then symlinked into $HOME/.config
It does not contain all the configs, just the ones i care about (especially the ones setting up my hyprland setup)

Currently contains setup for:
- mako (planning to switch to swaync)
- hyprland (hyprland, hipridle, hyprlock etc..)
- waybar
- clipse

It calso contains a local_bin folder, originally i had a `~/.local_bin` folder but now eberything is stored here, altough the things are symlinked back into `~/.local_bin` because i couldn't be bothered to change all occurrences of the path
